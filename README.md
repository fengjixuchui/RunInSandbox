# Run in Sandbox
Sample C++ project for launching executables and out-of-process COM servers in a sandboxed [low integrity level (IL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/dotnet/articles/bb625960(v%3dmsdn.10)) or [AppContainer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/secauthz/appcontainer-for-legacy-applications-) process on the *same machine*. There's no need to create any additional user accounts.

## Executable sandboxing
Run `RunInSandbox.exe [ac|li|mi|hi] ExePath` to launch the `ExePath` application in an AppContainer, low IL, medium IL or high IL process. This works for `STARTUPINFOEX`-based process creation.

## COM sandboxing
Run `RunInSandbox.exe [ac|li|mi|hi] ProgID [-g]` to launch the `ProgID` COM server in an AppContainer, low IL, medium IL or high IL process. The `-g` option is used to grant AppContainer permissions for the COM server, which only need to be done once.

Example usage:
* `RunInSandbox.exe ac TestControl.TestControl -g` to start the TestControl project in a AppContainer process and test its COM API.
* `RunInSandbox.exe li PowerPoint.Application` to start Microsoft PowerPoint in a low IL process connected using COM automation.

#### Client-side impersonation
This approach performs client-side user impersonation with `ImpersonateLoggedOnUser` for the current thread. Then the COM server is created with `CLSCTX_ENABLE_CLOAKING` to allow the COM server to be created with the current thread credentials.

| | Token impersonation overview |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Low integrity level  | Always works.                                            |
|AppContainer         | Works if `ALL_APPLICATION_PACKAGES` have been granted read&execute permissions for the COM EXE _and_ the corresponding `LaunchPermission` AppID registry key grant `ALL_APPLICATION_PACKAGES` local activation permission.  |

### Outstanding challenges
* How to apply `removableStorage` capability to enable USB stick access for the AppContainer.
* Why is `SetCursorPos` failing at medium IL _if_ the host is elevated (high IL). Impersonating the shell process (explorer.exe) to escape elevation doesn't seem to help. The problem appear to be caused by UIPI limitations tied to the foreground window.


## GrantAccess
Command-line tool to make a file or path writable by AppContainers and low IL process. Useful for whitelisting specific folders that should not be subject to application sandboxing.


## RunElevatedNet
C#/.Net sample code for launching an executable or COM class in an "elevated" process with admin privileges. The same functionality is also included in the RunInSandbox project.

## How to configure COM servers to always run as admin _with_ UAC

Read [COM Elevation Moniker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/com/the-com-elevation-moniker) for instructions for how to use User Account Control (UAC) prompts to request admin privileges for a COM server. UAC is general is documented in [How User Account Control works](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/user-account-control/how-user-account-control-works) Also need to explicitly call `CoInitializeSecurity` in the COM server to enable low privilege clients to connect.


Instructions:
* Build solution from Visual Studio started with admin privileges.
* To test, run `RunInSandbox.exe hi TestControl.TestControl` from a non-admin command prompt. This will trigger a UAC prompt (if UAC is enabled) before the COM server is started. The UAC prompt will require a password _if_ the current user is not an admin.

## How to configure COM servers to always run as admin _without_ UAC

`Component Services` (dcomcnfg.exe) can be used to explicitly set the user account used for out-of-proc COM servers. This can be used to make a COM server always run with admin privileges without requiring any UAC prompt. Also need to explicitly call `CoInitializeSecurity` in the COM server to enable low privilege clients to connect.


**WARNING**: This will introduce a privilege escalation vulnerability if not used carefully.

Instructions:
* From dcomcnfg.exe configure the COM server to always run through an administrative account.
* Verify that the account have sufficient filesystem permissions to run the COM server.
* To test, run `RunInSandbox.exe TestControl.TestControl` from a limited account. This will trigger creation of a TestControl.exe under an admin account with a COM communication channel between the processes.

CoCreateInstance calls from non-admin accounts will now start the COM server using an admin account.
